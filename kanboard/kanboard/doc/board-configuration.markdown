### Task highlighting

This feature display a shadow around the task when a task is moved recently.

Set the value 0 to disable this feature, 2 days by default (172800 seconds).

Everything moved since 2 days will have shadow around the task.

### Refresh interval for public board

When you share a board, the page will refresh automatically every 60 seconds by default.

### Refresh interval for private board

When your web browser is open on a board, Kanboard check every 10 seconds if something have been changed by someone else.

Technically this process is done by Ajax polling.
