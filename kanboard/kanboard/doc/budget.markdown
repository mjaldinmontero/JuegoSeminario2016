Budget management
=================

Budget management is based on the subtask time tracking, the user timetable and the user hourly rate.

This section is available from project settings page: **Project > Budget**. There is also a shortcut from the dropdown menu on the board.

Budget lines

Budget lines are used to define a budget for the project.
This budget can be adjusted by adding a new entry with an effective date.

Cost breakdown

Based on the subtask time tracking table and user information you can see the cost of each subtask.

The time spent is rounded to nearest quarter.

Budget graph

Finally, by combining all information we can generate a graph:

- Expenses represents user cost
- Budget lines are the provisioned budget
- Remaining is the budget left at the given time
