Closing tasks
=============

When a task is closed, they are hidden from the board.

However, you can always access to the list of closed tasks by using the query **status:closed** in any search form or simply choose **Closed tasks** from the filter dropdown.

There are two different way to close a task, from the task dropdown menu on the board:

Or from the task sidebar menu in the task detail view:

Note: When you close a task, all subtasks not completed will be changed to the status "Done".
