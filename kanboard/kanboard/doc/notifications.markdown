Notifications
=============

Kanboard is able to send notifications through several channels:

- Email
- Jabber/XMPP
- Hipchat
- Slack

Actually, Jabber/Hipchat/Slack notifications are sent to a room or group channel because they are configured at the project level.
However, email notifications are sent to an individual person.

User notifications
------------------

Each user must enable the notifications in their profile: **User Profile > Email notifications**. It's disabled by default.

You need of course a valid email address in you profile and the application must be configured to send emails.

For each project your are member, you can choose to receive notifications for:

- All tasks
- Only for tasks assigned to you
- Only for tasks created by you
- Only for tasks created by you and assigned to you

You can also select only some projects, by default it's all projects where you are member.
