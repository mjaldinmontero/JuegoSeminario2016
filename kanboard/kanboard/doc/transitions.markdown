Task transitions
================

Transitions record each movement of the tasks between columns.

Available from the task view, you can see those information:

- Date of the action
- Source column
- Destination column
- Executer (user that move the task)
- Time spent in the origin column

Task transition data can also be exported from the project settings page.

For the specified time range you will generate a CSV file that you can use with any spreadsheet software.
